# Shopping cart exercise brief

> âš  Please read the instructions thoroughly before you begin. Take some time to plan your work and budget **no more than 3 hours** to complete.

This is a partial implementation of a shopping till system, which you might find at a supermarket.
This implementation was started by another developer but the implementation was never completed. You have been tasked with improving and completing this project.
You may make any technical decisions you would like, but must not change the given abstract class (abc.ShoppingCart) which is used by the shopping till hardware and cannot be easily updated.
Please treat this code as an element of a larger production system.

The objectives for this exercise are as follows:
- Make the receipt print items in the order that they were added.
- Add a 'Total' line to the receipt. This should be the full price we should charge the customer.
- Be able to fetch product prices from an external source (E.g. json file, csv, database).
- Be able to display the product prices in different currencies (not only Euro).
- Update the test suite to extend coverage and make the tests robust so that changes to the code should rarely require changes to the tests.
- Any other changes which improve the reliability of this code in production.
- Any other changes which improve the maintainability of this code for other developers.

If you do not have enough information, make any assumptions you would like and note them down with TODO comments. Feel free to annotate your work with comments that highlight completion of the tasks listed above.

The code should be production ready, clean and tested. Please ensure the code is version controlled. Please make several commits with clear and sensible commit messages while working on this.

When you are ready to submit your completed exercise, please either:
- Provide a Github/GitLab/etc. link that we can view and clone your work; or
- Use git-bundle (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) to create a bundle file and send this to us.
